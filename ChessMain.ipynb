    "# This program is a chess game. The user may play against a friend or the\n",
    "# computer.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The game state is mainly stored as a 2D list of strings, and most of the\n",
    "# processing is thus done on a list of strings.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The GUI takes the current state and displays it on the screen. The GUI allows\n",
    "# drag and drop movement of pieces as well as click-click movement.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The AI that plays against the human evaluates all possible moves made by either\n",
    "# player up to a certain level of depth. The AI evaluates each position by giving\n",
    "# it a score. The higher the value of the score, the more favourable a position\n",
    "# is for white and the lower the value of the score, the more favourable the\n",
    "# position is for black. Knowing that white will try to get the score to be higher\n",
    "# and black will try and get the score to be lower, the AI assumes best play from\n",
    "# either side as it traverses up the search tree and chooses the best move to be\n",
    "# played. A problem that may arise is the number of postions that need to be\n",
    "# evaulated. Even at 3 levels of depth, thousands of positions have to be\n",
    "# evaluatd.\n",
    "# Several methods are used in this program to reduce positions that are searched:\n",
    "# 1. Alpha-beta pruning: As a result of  evaluating a position it can be found\n",
    "# that a portion of the search tree can be ignored as no further evaluations can\n",
    "# guarantee better results. This can happen because white and black area against\n",
    "# one another. White plays what is best for it and black plays what is best for it,\n",
    "# so it would make sense for white to ignore any portion of the tree where black\n",
    "# has a clear upperhand that it can choose to play.\n",
    "# 2. Transposition table: Often, two different pathways in a search tree can result\n",
    "# in the same board being evaluated. Instead of evaluating the same board several\n",
    "# times, the program stores a table of values in a dictionary where the keys are\n",
    "# the positions. This way, repeated positions can have their evaluations looked up\n",
    "# fairly quickly, as the board state is hashed.\n",
    "# 3. Opening Book - The opening book is again a dictionary that stores board\n",
    "# positions often seen in the beginning few moves in chess. Appropraite moves that\n",
    "# can be played at such positions is stored in the dictionary. A random move is\n",
    "# selected and played from the list of suggested moves wihtout searching if the AI\n",
    "# finds itself confronting a such a board postion. Note that this opening book was\n",
    "# recorded by myself and so it does not have many positions stored in it.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# In order to traverse the search tree as above, the AI needs to know how to evaluate the\n",
    "# board at any position to decide if white or black has the advantage. My evaluation\n",
    "# function currently looks at three main things when evaluating the board:\n",
    "#    a) Material for white and black. Each piece has a value and the more pieces you have,\n",
    "#        the better off your position is likely to be. For example, if white has an extra\n",
    "#        queen, it has an advantage over black.\n",
    "#    b) Piece-square table values - for each piece, there is a table that stores the best\n",
    "#        squares that the particular piece should occupy. So if white has a knight at a\n",
    "#        good square that controls the centre of the board, whereas black has a knight\n",
    "#        at the corner of the board, the situation is evaluated as being more favourable\n",
    "#        for white.\n",
    "#    c) Reduction in points for doubled pawns, isolated pawns, and blocked pawns. If any\n",
    "#        side has a set of pawns with the above features their points are slightly lower\n",
    "#        to indicate a slight disadvantage in such a position.\n",
    "#    d) A checkmate: a position where this has occured gets a very high point, so that the\n",
    "#        AI moves towards this if it can. (or avoids it).\n",
    "#\n",
    "# There are also several ways in which this program may be improved:\n",
    "# 1. Move ordering: Given a certain position and the AI needs to search a few layers\n",
    "# deep from it, somehow pre-sorting each move by ranking them in their likelihood of\n",
    "# being good moves allows for earlier cut-offs to be made by alpha-beta pruning.\n",
    "# 2. Iterative Deepening: Instead of going directly to a given depth when searching,\n",
    "# the A.I. may evaluate the best move at depth 1, then depth 2, then depth 3, etc.\n",
    "# until it reaches the final depth it needed to calculate at depth n. The reason for\n",
    "# this is that it may be mathematically shown that this does not dignificantly increase\n",
    "# computation and allows the A.I. to make its best move if it needs to abide by a\n",
    "# time limit.\n",
    "# 3. Better data structure - I believe the structure I have used to keep the state of\n",
    "# the board (list of a list) may be slowing down accessing its elements or assigning\n",
    "# its elements. Improvement in efficiency of my code by changing data structures may\n",
    "# potentially improve the speed at which my AI makes its move.\n",
    "# 4. Import of large opening tables: There are databases available online that store\n",
    "# the best moves played by grandmasters at various key opening positions of the chess\n",
    "# game. Although my AI does make use of an opening table that I recorded for it myself,\n",
    "# it is not able to respond to many opening positions using the table since the table\n",
    "# only convers few positions. If an opening table with millions of positions could be\n",
    "# imported to this program, the AI's moves would improve in the beginning. It would also\n",
    "# give it more variety in terms of the move it plays. Furthermore, using good openings\n",
    "# allows the AI to make the best moves in the field it is best at: middle game tactics.\n",
    "# 5. Better evaluation of positions - The current features evaluated by the evaluation\n",
    "# function when judging a positoin to give it a score allows for good opening games and\n",
    "# tactics that often allow it to gain advantage over the opponents that I have tested it\n",
    "# against. However, there are many aspects of playing good chess that it does not\n",
    "# consider: like having good mobility of your pieces (eg a trapped bishop should be bad\n",
    "# for the AI but it doesn't know that). Other aspects include king safety, pawn structure,\n",
    "# etc. It could also use different evaluation for each game phase. For example, a pawn is\n",
    "# not worth much at the opening phase of the game but in the endgame it is very important\n",
    "# and so should be evaulated as a valuable piece.\n",
    "# 6. Endgame tables - As good as my AI may be in middle games, given a queen and a king to\n",
    "# attempt checkmate against a lone king, it would be unlikely for it to succeed. This is\n",
    "# because such checkmates, despite being simple, require a large number of combination of\n",
    "# moves to occur, the depth of which my AI would not be able to see. So endgame table allows\n",
    "# it to know (for a very large number of endgame positions) the best move to play in order\n",
    "# to attempt a win or a draw (or try its best to avoid a loss).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#Note about coordinates:\n",
    "#Normally, algebraic notation is used to specify a box on a chess board. In this\n",
